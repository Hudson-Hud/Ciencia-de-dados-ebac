# Ciencia-de-dados-ebac

I am developing a step-by-step guide with tips, in-depth studies and projects that involve the study of data science that is being taught by EBAC (British School of Creative Arts & Technology).

In this material, you can find studies on important Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib. Matplotlib, Seaborn, among others.

You will also have a lot of analysis in Machine Learning, learning about git and github, studies in statistics and much more.
